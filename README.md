SneakPeep
=========

My own version of PeepingTom with a few changes

1) Added multithreading so downloads go faster
2) Everything is done in html and saved to one file
3) Pages are interactive
4) I haven't yet added support for parsing anything but a simple list

Usage: `./peep.py  [list of hosts] [port] [number of concurrent tasks]`
